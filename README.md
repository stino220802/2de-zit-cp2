# 2de-zit-cp2
task 2nd chance cprogramming 2 
I made this project for a assignment in school. This project takes an input bmp picture and outputs 4 different files.
3 Files have the RGB colors split, so a file for the red colors, one for green and one for blue. The other file has all colors combined but inverted. 
I learned how to use pointers, structs, filehandling and how a bmp picture works. 
U can use the file by making a .o file from personalLibrary.c and then linking that to the main.c file.
